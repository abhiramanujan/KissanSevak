This app is used by the farmers and the wholesalers(retailers).

It will help farmers to sell his crops directly to the retailers, by setting a base price for his crop, and many retailers bid for certain products they want from the farmers. 
This app uses a bidding system, for selling of crops from farmer side to the retailer side. This helps farmer to gain some profit, otherwise they used to get manipulated by the middlemen.

There are login seperately for a farmer and a retailer.

The farmer side :-
The farmer can add the crop to his list and set a base price for his crop, or otherwise the government that help in setting the base orice for them.
He/She can edit their list depending on the transactions they have done to the retailers.

The retailer side :-

The retailer can login in his account and choose the category of crops he/she wants(options are Vegetables,Fruits, Flowers).
After they select one or more from this, they will get information of the farmers crops and how much their base price is.
They can select one or more items from that list and bid for that.
Once a retailer starts bidding, then all other retailers who uses this app will get a notification about the current bid for an item they have also bidded for or going to bid for.


This app will be updated accordingly..
